Lean On
Emiway Bantai, Celina Sharma
Know you've got pain
Deal with it on your own
You go insane
I wanna help move the load
Oh, out your way
But I can't make you
You've gotta want to
So if you ever feel the need to
You can call me on a late ni-night
You can take your time
You can always count on me
If you ever don't feel alright
You can't see the light
I'll be that somebody
Lean on me
Know I'll be there too
Lean on me
I'll be that somebody
Lean on me
तेरे अलावा I need nobody
Let's take a walk and leave the गाड़ी, skrrt
तू ही party मेरी, after party
Gonna lean on you 'cause I need somebody, bae aye
Life change हुआ, जबसे तू आयी lady मेरे range में
दिल पे तो पहले से बसी थी
अब damage दिया तूने मेरे brain पे
कश्ती को इंतज़ार है किनारे का
प्यार करें, क्यूँ सोचे हम ये ज़ालिम ज़माने का?
Public को रहता इंतज़ार हर महीने मेरे गाने का
और मेको इंतज़ार था यहाँ तेरे सहारे का
You can call me on a late ni-night
You can take your time
You can always count on me
If you ever don't feel alright
You can't see the light
I'll be that somebody
Lean on me
Know I'll be there too
Lean on me
I'll be that somebody
Lean on me
No more bad days
Now I got my fan base
You're the one who made me smile on my sad days
I'ma lean on you
Yeah, I'ma lean on you
Doesn't matter wherever I be
All you gotta do is lean on me
When it gets too much just shout for me
Shout for me, yeah
You can call me on a late ni-night
You can take your time
You can always count on me
If you ever don't feel alright
You can't see the light
I'll be that somebody
Lean on me
Know I'll be there too
Lean on me
I'll be that somebody
You can call me on a late ni-night
You can take your time
You can always count on me
If you ever don't feel alright
You can't see the light
I'll be that somebody
Lean on me
Know I'll be there too
Lean on me
I'll be that somebody
Lean on me
बहुत hard
